To run the code, please open a terminal and type "python3 NSO.py", then a user interface should be shown. 

The desired functions are: 
1. Load log files and gather useful information. When pressing the "Start Parsing" button, the top frame shows email information and the bottom shows website information; 
2. Export obtained information and save it to other files. 

Please note that due to time limitation, the prototype is not fully implemented yet. 

The log files are generated by sslsplit.
